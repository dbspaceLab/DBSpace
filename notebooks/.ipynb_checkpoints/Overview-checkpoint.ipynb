    "# DBSpace: Overview\n",
    "## Environment for network electrophysiology in Psychiatric Deep Brain Stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "DBSpace is library to perform analysis on multimodal, network-level clinical electrophysiology in the context of psychiatric deep brain stimulation. It consists of several submodules that, together, work from raw data to models and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundations for this library were built from 2012 - 2018 during my PhD work in the labs of Dr. Helen Mayberg and Dr. Robert Butera. This library was developed as a part of a project in DBS for Depression, but the tools should be generalizable to any disorder that is captured by clinical scales. This has not been rigorously tested and there are no guarantees outside of the use of TRD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Publications\n",
    "The DBSpace libraries were used in several publications (hopefully...). A partial list is found below\n",
    "\n",
    "* Confounding oscillations\n",
    "* Cortical Response to antidepressant DBS \n",
    "* Intraoperative online classifier for SCCwm-DBS\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generalizability\n",
    "While these libraries were developed for analysis in a study of antidepressant DBS, the approaches taken are generalizations that should remain applicable to motor disorders (*rapid* symptom state changes) as they address psychiatric disorders (*slow* symptom state changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure\n",
    "DBSpace is divided into five sublibraries:\n",
    "* Preprocessing\n",
    "* Analysis\n",
    "* Simulation\n",
    "* Readout\n",
    "* Control\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "The primary goal of the classes and methods in preprocessing are to bring in LFP, dEEG, and ECoG data into a usable form. Flexibility of these routines are prioritized as new hardware emerges with differing noise and artifact profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed and hands-on documentation of the preprocessing sublibrary, go [here]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "The primary goal of the classes and methods in analysis are to actually make statements about the recordings with the assumption that they reflect brain signals. Most of this library is (as of 2018) written primarily for oscillatory-domain analysis with some generalized frequency-domain and time-frequency-domain analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed and hands-on documentation of the analysis sublibrary, go [here]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation\n",
    "Here, we simulate electrophysiology in a way relevant to analysis of real-world clinical electrophysiology using contemporary DBS tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, go [here]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Biometric\n",
    "Here, we take several regression based approaches to extract disease-state relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, go [here]()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Control\n",
    "In this sublibrary, we focus on capturing the short-term effects of DBS on measurable electrophysiology, with the assumption that DBS modulates dynamics in a latent brain network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details, go [here]().\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll cover the basics of loading in data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we'll cover one approach to cleaning the LFP recordings from the Activa PC+S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we'll describe and demonstrate several power user oriented tools that can help in assessing and analysing LFP recordings from the PC+S.\n"
